# Hey, I'm Jacopo 👋

I'm a software engineer who spent the last 10 years working on infrastructure automation, and a deep tech technical founder. In 2016 I bootstrapped [SIGHUP](https://github.com/sighupio) (now sold, 7 figures exit 🎉) where we created one of the most popular (and still used by the industry) independent Kubernetes distributions — you can find it [here](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) and should check it out. Did I mention that this is probably **THE ONLY** low-level distribution created and maintained entirely in Europe? 🇪🇺

In 2025, I moved on from SIGHUP and joined ING as Lead for Infrastructure Transformation ✨. Creating and running SIGHUP over the past 10 years was a life-long lesson and I'm thankful to have been able to work with some of the most talented people I've met in my career. Still, it was time to move on and enjoy my exit.
